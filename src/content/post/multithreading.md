## What is Multithreading?

Multithreading is the ability of a CPU, to execute multiple processes or threads concurrently. The idea is that a CPU can work on multiple threads at the same time, thus making more efficient use of the CPU time.

## Multithreading on PHP

Multithreading is not a native feature of PHP, but there are some libraries that allow us to achieve this.

### Pthreads

Pthreads is a PHP extension that allows to implement multithreading in PHP. The pthreads extension includes all the tools, classes and interfaces you need to create multithreaded applications. [Pthreads](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pthreads.php)

### ReactPHP

ReactPHP is a low-level library for event-driven programming in PHP. At its core is an event loop, on top of which it provides low-level utilities, such as: Streams abstraction, async dns resolver, network client/server, http client/server, interaction with processes. Third-party libraries can use these components to create async network clients/servers and more. [ReactPHP](https://reactphp.org/)

### Laravel Queues

Laravel Queues provide a unified API across a variety of different queue backends, such as Beanstalk, Amazon SQS, Redis, or even a relational database. Queues allow you to defer the processing of a time consuming task, such as sending an email, until a later time. Deferring these time consuming tasks drastically speeds up web requests to your application. [Laravel Queues](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/queues)

### Laravel Horizon

Laravel Horizon provides a beautiful dashboard and code-driven configuration for your Redis queues. Horizon allows you to easily monitor key metrics of your queue system such as job throughput, runtime, and job failures. [Laravel Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/horizon)
